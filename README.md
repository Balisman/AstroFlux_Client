## Quick summary as to what this is
It's a little side project of mine where I'm aiming to reimplement all of the modified client features on top of a fresh unmodified client and clean stuff up along the way. I also have a few ideas I want to add on top of everything else that is already in the base modified clients. ~~Currently this project is in its infancy.~~
After 24 hours, this has grown into quite the effort. Big thanks to everyone coming in for some help. At this pace it will soon be finished.
