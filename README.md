## Quick summary as to what this is
It's a little side project of mine where I'm aiming to reimplement all of the modified client features on top of a fresh unmodified client and clean stuff up along the way. I also have a few ideas I want to add on top of everything else that is already in the base modified clients. Currently this project is in its infancy.

### Currently orking on
- With the FileManager done, I also managed to get zooming to work. Now i'm just making it more robust and smoothing it out around the edges

### ToDo
- [ ] Zooming
- [ ] Fitness
- [ ] Purify
- [ ] Autofarm
- [ ] Autorecycle
- [ ] Stacking :P
- [ ] Hacked Hangar
- [ ] Autosave of custom settings

### Ideas
- Progress mode in encounter menu (on by default)
- Prediction for art upgrades (MAXI already has a working implementation)
- Autotrain for crew members
- Modifiable hp/sh bar size and damage text size in settings menu
