## Quick summary as to what this is
It's a little side project of mine where I'm aiming to reimplement all of the modified client features on top of a fresh unmodified client and clean stuff up along the way. I also have a few ideas I want to add on top of everything else that is already in the base modified clients. Currently this project is in its infancy.

### Currently working on
- Knocking easy stuff off

### ToDo
- [x] Zooming
- [ ] Fitness
- [ ] Fitness Config Menu
- [ ] Purify
- [ ] Autofarm
- [ ] Autorecycle
- [ ] Stacking :P
- [ ] Hacked Hangar
- [ ] Autosave of custom settings
- [x] Fix up artifacts menu button allignment
- [ ] Progress mode in encounter menu
- [ ] Variable crew member skill point usage
- [ ] Art upgrade prediction
- [ ] Modifiable hp/sh bar and dmg text size
- [ ] Move welcome text up a bit
- [ ] Increase FPS cap on warp menu 30 -> 60

### Ideas
- Autotrain for crew members
- Variable skill point usage for crew members (really sucks having to click 500 times lmao)
- Max out option for crew member talents
