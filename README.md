## Quick summary as to what this is
It's a little side project of mine where I'm aiming to reimplement all of the modified client features on top of a fresh unmodified client and clean stuff up along the way. I also have a few ideas I want to add on top of everything else that is already in the base modified clients. ~~Currently this project is in its infancy.~~
After 24 hours, this has grown into quite the effort. Big thanks to everyone coming in for some help. At this pace it will soon be finished.

It has been over a month since I undertook this project. There's now a team of contributors behind me and it has come a long way. I appreciate everyone who has taken time out of their day to contribute with their work. It's pretty amazing what point we've reached. Very close to making this the standard client for the game, be on the lookout for that ;)
